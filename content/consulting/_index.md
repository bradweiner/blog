I am available for limited consulting engagements.  

I have more than a decade of experience helping colleges and universities leverage
their institutional data to advance institutional missions.

Areas of expertise include:

##### Building Data Science Teams and Processes

Data Science work starts with good research questions and scientific processes. I can help you build an organizational structure that serves your institutional needs while helping Data Scientists to do what they do best.

* Defining Roles  
* Building out technology processes (Github/Version controlled code repositories, Kanban/Agile Tools, shared data repositories) 
* Building out people processes (Stakeholder needs assessments, research question design, management structures)

##### Ed-Tech Effectiveness and Accuracy Testing

Third party educational technology can provide a lot of value and focus to your institution. But, let's face it: they don't always deliver on what they promise. As an alumnus of an ed-tech, higher education data company, I've worked with product managers, account representatives and executives and would love to be your partner in shaping these partnerships. I can:

* Determine if the product fits your needs
* Build a short term strategy to test the efficacy of the tool
* Test the accuracy of predictive models 
* Act as an objective third party to ask difficult questions about model specification and algorithmic bias
* Work with ed-tech product managers to help you get the most out of your relationship

* Serve on search or interview committees for skills/coding tests

##### Strategic Planning for Modernizing IR/Data Analytics

The best time to plant a tree was either ten years ago or today. I can help you build a long term vision to modernize your current analytics practices into an agile, transformative, analytics operation. Whether it's a large team or single person, I can help you set up a an analytics strategy that serves your institution for many years into the future.
