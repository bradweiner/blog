<h3>Tech Joy</h3>
<p>Do you remember the first time you used Google?</p>
<p>I sure do. My friend Spencer showed it to me on an old laptop in my now-<a href="https://www.kansan.com/news/kbor-approves-demolition-of-55-year-old-oliver-hall/article_479aff3e-916b-11eb-bc91-9fb91b2a7095.html">demonlished</a> first-year residence hall. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It was remarkable how quickly it got answers and how effectively it sorted the best content. I Googled for hours on end, enjoying the luxurty of information at my fingertips, delivered at sweet, sweet, residence hall T1 speeds <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It felt like magic. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I had a similar, but perhaps less enthusiastic enjoyment when I first got to Ask Jeeves questions rather than clicking through the endless, non-searchable Yahoo directory which, was a giant improvement over, well…nothing at all. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This past weekend, people from all over the world experienced similar “tech joy” from the the new OpenAI tool <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>. For those who haven’t give it a test, ChatGPT is an AI model that was trained to take in semantic, chat-like, requests, and then generate new (or remixed) outputs based on those requests. Unlike previous iterations of language-based models, ChatGPT has benefited from detailed human tuning, which will hopefully prevent it from becoming a racist jerk-bot. It’s specification and reward system also allows it to generate “…followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.” This creates a far more interactive experience, akin to a conversation, or as some have suggested, a Socratic dialogue with a professor.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable innovation which, naturally, spurred discussions in two spaces where I happen to sit: data science and higher education.</p>
</div>
<div id="ai-and-the-end-of-higher-education" class="section level3">
<h3>AI and the End of Higher Education</h3>
<p>Among the most immediate discussions about ChatGPT was whether it might destroy our higher education model as we know it. After all, a conversational bot that can iteratively walk you through a problem sounds a lot like an inexpensive, scalable instructor. Right?</p>
<p>The death of the academy is a common refrain when technology moves forward.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It’s been predicted for decades, perhaps centuries. And, it continues to this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/">day</a>. While the modern volleys <em>often</em> hail, from Silicon Valley techno-Utopians and ed-tech VCs, there are many of us in the education policy and finance spaces who openly recognize the challenges to the overall operating model.</p>
<p>Given higher ed’s slow pace of change, substantial fixed costs, and imperfect decision-making, massive exogenous shocks (like COVID-19 or AI) could accelerate those changes. But is the current model of higher education doomed by a highly sophisticated AI model?</p>
<p>My sense (which is biased, limited, and probabilistic) is that no, higher education as we know it isn’t very likely to end or be substantially different over a medium time horizon.</p>
<p>The rationale is this: a liberal arts, technical, or creative education isn’t just about figuring out the answers to well-structured questions, it’s about learning how to ask good questions. Indeed, one of the ironies of the ChatGPT discourse is that well-educated, experienced people are having their minds blown by detailed answers to questions that are useful to them <em>now</em> without considering or remembering an earlier, intellectual <em>tabula rasa</em>.</p>
<p>Put another way: It’s easier for people who are <em>traditionally</em> educated to query “Build me a Python tutorial” and self-learn from there, than it is for someone who isn’t quite sure what they want to learn, or what problems Python might solve in the first place. Furthermore, those who are <em>traditionally</em> educated are (in my opinion) more likely to detect logical flaws, inaccuracies, or factual holes. Self-learners, autodidacts, and the <em>traditionally</em> educated will benefit tremendously from AI-generated educational pathways, but the rest of the population may still need some guidance.</p>
<p>I don’t want to suggest that these tools aren’t educational groundbreaking or that they might not substantially change the way that we teach and learn. Furthermore, I don’t want to suggest that the patches-on-jackets experience will be the model forever. Higher education demands faster, cheaper, skill-based credentialing options that help educate more students, without the limiting fixed costs of a synchronous, classroom environment. Educators and institutions would be wise to leverage AI for its speed, flexibility, and economies of scale. But, buyer beware, early reports indicate that factual information from ChatGPT <em>seem</em> awesome, but may be gloriously, confidently, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-amazing-wrong">wrong</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="generative-language-ai-and-changes-to-pedagogy" class="section level3">
<h3>Generative Language AI and Changes to Pedagogy</h3>
<p>If the assumption above holds and our millennium-old institutions of higher education are not fully destroyed, then how will colleges and universities adopt these new technologies into our existing practices? This seems to be a much more interesting question since ChatGPT and it’s improved successors <em>can</em> do a lot of what we ask students to do: write essays, answer questions, generate code, apply for admission, etc. If students can use ChatGPT to generate seemingly original work, then how are we going to train<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> students to think critically, write convincing arguments or not pass off AI-generated work as their own?</p>
<p>Although I will openly admit to not having perfect answers, allow me to humbly propose a few ways in which educators can utilize modern AI tools while <em>also</em> developing graduates capable of thinking in a complex world. Please note that I am generally not into “futurism” and recognize that predictions are routinely wrong. I am not trying to indicate that this what the world <em>will</em> look like, but instead, presenting some ideas about ways in which generative language bots like ChatGPT could benefit the academic enterprise, without completely tearing it down.</p>
<div id="become-ai-adversaries" class="section level4">
<h4>Become AI Adversaries</h4>
<p>ChatGPT has been shown to be confidently wrong. This provides an incredible opportunity to turn student end users into fact-checkers. One can imagine an exercise where a professor creates a small series of AI-generated responses, and then asks students, in class, to find ways in which the responses are inaccurate, incomplete, biased, or misrepresented. This is exactly the type of inquiry that took place when Wikipedia first came out, and before it was as widely trusted as it is today.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-an-ai-write-a-thon" class="section level4">
<h4>Create an AI “Write-a-Thon”</h4>
<p>ChatGPT can produce workable text. However, the examples (even if correct) are bland and generic. One pedagogical option might be to set up something akin to an extemporaneous speech events at debate tournaments. For example, one might generate an AI response based on a known prompt. Then, students could be give a limited amount of time to write a better, more convincing, more engaging speech or paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="encourage-use-of-ai-for-knowledge-discovery-and-detecting-gaps-in-the-literature" class="section level4">
<h4>Encourage Use of AI for Knowledge Discovery and Detecting Gaps in the Literature</h4>
<p>AI is powerful and has every opportunity to <em>improve</em> our lives especially in the context of repetitive tasks that can be automated. This, in theory, leaves more time for the deeper creative and analytic work at which humans excel. This is already happening in a variety of <a href="https://www.contxmedia.com/robot-lawyers-save-morgan-stanley-millions-soliciting-fees">industries.</a></p>
<p>As someone who finds the endless maze of finding papers related to a research question, well…boring, I can imagine this being a space that is prime for some AI-guided assistance. For example, one might use ChatGPT (or its improved successors) for generating literature review summaries, course reading lists, article graphs, or bibliographies. If AI were able to rapidly synthesize the current state of the literature, it could also, potentially, detect or even recommend studies that would fill existing gaps, or surface discrepancies between similar studies that are ripe for reproduction.</p>
<p>I am guessing this idea won’t be popular among scholars who believe that the searching and the reading are part of the discovery process. Nevertheless, we have to ask ourselves whether some work that has previously been viewed as “critical” exists because we didn’t have an easier, more efficient way. If something like this were to be available, then maybe the “disruption” to academic research is actually a way to have less overlap in existing work, more novel research, and expedited timeline from idea to knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-students-as-human-ai-trainers" class="section level4">
<h4>Use Students as Human AI Trainers</h4>
<p>One of the best parts of ChatGPT is that it has clearly been honed and trained with the help of human beings who understand language and context. As AI becomes more accessible to build and deploy, surely one of the best educational use cases is to have students learn to build, train, and validate their own AI models. As much as we worry about it changing education, it is pretty clear that new technologies will precipitate new jobs and industries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you believe that education is some sort of home school workbook whereby correct answers to existing questions can be checked off in step wise fashion until some badge is unlocked, then ChatGPT or similar tools can and will be an acceptable substitute. If you believe that education is an exploration of ideas, and method by which you <em>learn</em> how to <em>learn</em> then ChatGPT can be a remarkable discovery tool, without replacing a human-centered educational experience.</p>

<div id="examples" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>I know some people who spent all weekend with the tool. I have barely scratched the surface but some initial queries included the following</p>
<p>Me: <em>write a bluegrass song describing breakfast menu items</em><br />
AI:</p>
<p>Verse 1:<br />
I woke up this morning, feeling fine<br />
Thinking about what I’d like to dine<br />
I headed down to the kitchen with a smile<br />
To make myself a bluegrass breakfast worth the while</p>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Bluegrass breakfast, full of flavor<br />
Makes my heart sing and my taste buds savor<br />
Bacon sizzling, eggs a-frying<br />
Grits a-boiling, coffee a-pouring</p>
<p>Verse 2:<br />
I started with a stack of pancakes hot and sweet<br />
Topped with butter and a drizzle of maple syrup treat<br />
I fried up some eggs and crispy bacon too<br />
And stirred up a pot of creamy grits, just the thing to do</p>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Bluegrass breakfast, full of flavor<br />
Makes my heart sing and my taste buds savor<br />
Bacon sizzling, eggs a-frying<br />
Grits a-boiling, coffee a-pouring</p>
<p>Verse 3:<br />
I poured myself a mug of steaming hot black coffee<br />
To wash down all the tasty food, that’s the way to be<br />
I sat down at the table, and dug in with delight<br />
A bluegrass breakfast feast, a beautiful sight</p>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Bluegrass breakfast, full of flavor<br />
Makes my heart sing and my taste buds savor<br />
Bacon sizzling, eggs a-frying<br />
Grits a-boiling, coffee a-pouring</p>
